RestRate has a simple mission: to provide both regular and smart phones with a fast and instructive way to find out about a restaurant before choosing to dine. It returns a rating from the Factual API and the NYC Sanitation Grade, which was found on OpenData.

To use, your number must be verified on the Twilio API. Then text your query to **9175252351**. You can query the name of a restaurant. If you have the zip code you can query restaurant name, zip (don't forget that space!)

The web side of our project, where you will be able to type in your number and view the history of the restaurants you searched up (great way to remember a place you didn't have time to visit) can be found on [ml7.stuycs.org:7201](ml7.stuycs.org:7201).
