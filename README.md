============

RestText has a simple mission: to provide both regular and smart phones with a fast and instructive way to find out about a restaurant before choosing to dine. It returns a rating from the Factual API and the NYC Sanitation Grade, which was found on OpenData.
While RestText is helpful, to smart phone users it allows people with
  regular phones to greatly increase the functionality of their phones
  through sms messaging.When the user texts 1-917-525-2351 the name
  of the restaurant they would like to learn about the app will then return a text
  message with a rating for the restaurant based on the factual
  database. It will also return the sanitation rating given to every
  restaurant in the New York City Metropolitan area.<br>
  
<b>Note</b>: The app is no longer being hosted
